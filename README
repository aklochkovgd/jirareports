Couple of scripts which generate reports out of JIRA worklogs.
JIRA SOAP API is used to gather data. 

Before using the scripts create ~/.jira file with content like this:

[default]
username=aklochkov
password=secret
uri=https://issues.griddynamics.net/rpc/soap/jirasoapservice-v2?wsdl
project=XCOM
